              <h1> Which Mobile App Development Trends are on the Rise? </h1>
              <h2>Blog Post</h2>
              <p class="portfolio-text">The smartphone has become an indispensable tool in the day to day activities of users from around the world. By growing in popularity, we have seen the smartphone evolve to meet a wide variety of needs. However, this also means that today, the mobile domain is extremely saturated and competitive.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text">This is why developers have to be keenly aware of users’ needs and find a way to stand out in the huge app marketplace. Here are 10 trends that developers have to keep in mind when designing a new app:</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>1. Growth of Cloud Technology</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Cloud technology will provide mobile devices with features such as extended battery life, and improved processing power, data storage capacity, scalability and reliability. (1) Developers will get several big benefits as well, with cloud based app development platforms. These platforms will speed up the app development process, and allow developers to implement cloud technology into their apps easier.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>2. Wearable Tech</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">We’ve seen the Apple Watch start the trend of wearable tech in 2014, and so far, most of the apps developed for this kind of device have been fitness apps. However, we are seeing this technology spread and evolve. First of all, there’s an increasing variety in the type of apps people are developing (productivity apps for example), and second, there’s an increasing variety in how this tech is worn. The textile and fashion industries are both looking for ways to integrate wearable tech into their products.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>3. Security in Apps</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Security is going to be a major concern in the future. Both 2014 and 2015 have seen major app security problems, with one prediction stating that 75% of mobile apps will fail a basic security test. (6) In fact, in 2014, 1 billion personal data records were compromised by cyber-attacks, and it was estimated that as many as 11.6 million mobile devices are infected with malware at any given time (5). This security risk is further compounded by the emergence of IoT and mobile wallets, which present their own sets of challenges and fears.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>4. Faster Mobile Development</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">The mobile app demand and mobile app market are both exploding, and enterprises are having a hard time keeping up. This means that app development has to become faster and more efficient. We will see new advanced app development tools and frameworks in the near future. These new tools will allow for a shorter time period between the planning stage and app launch.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>5. Beacon Technology</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Apple first introduced the iBeacon technology in 2013, and it was a little slow to catch on. Now with beacon technology expected to come to Android, and to generate $44 billion in retail sales by 2016, it’s starting to grab people’s attention (2). Beacon technology allows mobile devices to alert apps or websites when users enter a certain location. Using this information, businesses and retailers can communicate with the user through their apps or websites, sending personalized messages and promotions. Beacon technology is already being used by stores and airlines for promotions, and Major League Baseball for seat upgrades. A particularly interesting use of this technology is seen in Starwood Hotels’ initiative to replace room keys with beacons.  (2)</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>6. Enterprises Gravitating Towards App Creation</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">According to the IDC, IT organizations will use at least 25% of their software budget on mobile application development, management and deployment by the year 2017. The number of enterprise applications optimized for mobility is also expected to be four times higher by 2016. (3) As you can see, app developers will have huge opportunities to work on applications in the enterprise market.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>7. M-Commerce</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Mobile commerce is expected to account for 24.4% of overall ecommerce revenue by the year 2017. Several analysts expect this to be an ongoing trend, as more and more people get used to purchasing online on their mobile device. Proper m-commerce app development also plays a big role in the growth of m-commerce. We’re seeing a focus on smoothing out the User Experience for these apps, and developing a much safer and faster checkout process.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>8. Mobile Wallet and Social Payments</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Using a mobile device instead of a credit card will become more popular in the future, thanks to Google Wallet and Apple Pay. But that’s not all. There are many innovative ways in which users can transfer money, and we’re seeing them pop-up in a variety of apps. You have Snapcash, from the developers of Snapchat, which allows users to send money to each other by typing a dollar sign followed by an amount in chat. You also have Twitter Buy, which adds a Buy button to sponsored Tweets. (4)</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>9. HTML 5</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">HTML5 has been growing in popularity. Thanks to its development tools, many businesses choose it when they want to create hybrid mobile apps, which can work on multiple platforms. This is a trend we will continue to see in the future, as native apps take a backseat and hybrid apps become more popular.</p>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>10. The Growing Priority of the User Experience</p></b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">The user experience is becoming an important element of app development. As monetization options become more prevalent, the user experience has to keep up. This also means that there are tremendous opportunities for the developer who can properly harness the buying power of the user. This is where analytics tools such as Appsee start to play an important part. By receiving instant, detailed feedback, developers can adjust the UX and increase conversion rates.
