                            <h1> RFID </h1>
              <h2>Website Content</h2>
              <p class="portfolio-text">RFID technology has revolutionized supply chain management. Supply chain management encompasses all of the activities that revolve around the flow of goods, from manufacturing to distribution. It is a very complex and knowledge intensive process that incorporates other aspects of the business, including marketing decisions, and customer demand.
              <p class="portfolio-text">RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. It is a spiritual successor to the barcode, and it uses electromagnetic fields to automatically transmit electronically stored information. Unlike its predecessor, an RFID label can be detected and read from anywhere within its field of influence, and it can store much more information.
              <p class="portfolio-text">Here’s how RFID technology can help your business:
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>In the Automotive Industry</b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">In the automotive industry, RFID can offer a considerate competitive edge. It starts with the shipping and receiving of the components, which can be tagged individually straight from the suppliers. This allows for automatic receiving, where RFID data is compared to the data in the ERP system, significantly improving shipping accuracy, and cost recovery for incorrect shipments. In a similar vein, any non-conforming materials can be detected and removed in 1 day. Considering that this was a laborious and error prone part of the supply chain that took anywhere from 10 to 30 days to complete, RFID can offer a huge improvement.
              <p class="portfolio-text">RFID can also help with asset tracking. Suppliers often times face losses when shipping products to assembly plants. Each batch of goods is shipped using returnable totes and metal racks. Whenever a rack or tote goes missing, the expense is shouldered by the supplier if the supplier cannot prove which plant misplaced the containers. However, with RFID technology, it is possible to ID each tote and rack, assign them to an assembly plant, and to automatically register in an electronic database the outgoing/incoming containers. With this system in place, a supplier can detect which assembly plant did not return all of its totes and racks, and charge them accordingly.
              <p class="portfolio-text">In the post-production, RFID tagged vehicles will be able to relay all of the data regarding the car’s manufacturing history, which ensures that any rework can be completed efficiently, and that all cars reach the right destination.
              <p class="portfolio-text">To sum it up, in the automotive industry, RFID will:
              <ul>
              <li> Streamline the production process, from receiving the components, to sorting them and distributing them to the right production line.
              <li> Remove waste both in time and money, by ensuring that non-conforming materials are detected immediately.
              <li> Reduce losses from misplaced totes and racks.
              <li> Improve post-production processes by storing a vehicle’s manufacturing industry.
              </ul>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>In the Manufacturing Process</b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">The manufacturing process benefits from RFID labels especially in the FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, where the pace of production is very fast. As products go through the manufacturing process, they have to be counted multiple times: during production, washing and packaging. In the past, the counting was usually performed by laborers. With RFID labels, this process is automatic, which directly translates in lower operative costs. It’s worth noting that RFID labels serve this purpose in slower manufacturing processes as well.
              <p class="portfolio-text">Due to the RFID’s larger capacity for information storage, there is another benefit to be had on the production line. Real-time, accurate information can be received, stored and analyzed to improve the efficiency of the production line. Production bottlenecks can be identified, and improved upon. In a similar vein, information regarding the repair status of production equipment can be stored in RFID labels attached to the equipment. This can lead to better production planning by efficiently incorporating maintenance activities, and it can help prevent expensive breaks in production due to the equipment malfunctioning.
              <p class="portfolio-text">In short, here’s what you can expect if you start using RFID labels in your production process:
              <ul>
              <li>	Lower labor expenses, due to products being automatically tracked and counted.
              <li>	Improved data gathering and visibility, which translates into lower production costs, and higher ROIs.
              <li>	Improved maintenance schedules that weave seamlessly into the production process, removing the need for expensive production breaks.
              </ul>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>In Warehouse Management</b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">Once a good leaves the production line, it is packaged and sent off to the warehouse of the buying company, or of the freight forwarder. Here RFID technology can greatly improve information management. What was once a time and labor intensive process can be handled by equipping each cargo unit with RFID labels, and the entry of the warehouse with read-write equipment. When a cargo unit enters or leaves the warehouse, the data stored in the RFID labels is automatically registered and forwarded to the backend system. This automates the process and allows the warehouse management center to recognize, register and help with the placement of a vast amount of products in a much shorter period of time.
              <p class="portfolio-text">Additional read-write equipment can be placed into the warehouse, which will register all in-house movements, and allow for the strategic planning of product location within the warehouse, and better coordination between the cargo teams and the management center. Once products are stored, they are easy to find by the workers on the ground floor. RFID also allows for valuable information regarding product loses to be gathered.
              <p class="portfolio-text">So if you use RFID in your warehouse processes, you can expect:
              <ul>
              <li>	More efficiency due to the availability of real-time product information.
              <li>	Less time wasted on locating products.
              <li>	Better loss reduction procedures due to better data tracking.
              <li>	Better space management due to in-house product tracking.
              </ul>
              <p class="portfolio-text"><b>In Retail</b>
              <p class="portfolio-text">In the final link of the supply chain, RFID tags can have many advantages. Starting from a higher speed of delivery, to improved efficiency in product handling, and increased accuracy in the selection process. For example, RFID can be used to identify individual products in mixed-product pallets, notify management as products go out of stock, and track whether the shelves are fully stocked.
              <p class="portfolio-text">Read-write equipment at the entry gate can serve the same purpose it serves in a warehouse – notify the backend system whenever new products arrive. If the products themselves are labeled, sorting can be done more efficiently and accurately. This will also lead to increased security, with the RFID labels acting as theft deterrents.
              <p class="portfolio-text">In retail, RFID will:
              <ul>
              <li>	Accelerate delivery and sorting, which leads to a higher turnover.
              <li>	Improve efficiency when it comes to stocking the shelves.
              <li>	Reduce losses by preventing theft.
              <li>	Lower costs by reducing the amount of labor needed to handle the products.
              </ul>
